// Command changelog answers the two questions a release asks of CHANGELOG.md:
// which version the file declares, and what that version's release notes say.
//
// It is the whole of the release trigger. A version heading with no published
// release is a release request, so the file is validated in full before either
// answer is given: a malformed changelog fails here, in a pull request, rather
// than halfway through a publish that cannot be undone.
//
// Nothing is printed when the file asks for no release - a changelog with no
// version section yet, or whose newest version was yanked. That is a normal
// answer, not an error, and it is what makes a routine merge a no-op.
